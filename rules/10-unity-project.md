# Project Structure

This project uses Unity. It follows the general Unity project structure and has the following directory structure:

- PROJECT-ROOT/
  - Assets/ # Development project code and assets
  - Documentation/ # Developer documentation
  - Library/
    - PackageCache/ # Caching dependent UPM packages
  - Packages/ # Embedded packages

## Feature Assembly Structure

A development project is divided into one or more feature folders, and each feature folder has the following structure:
Feature folders are placed under Assets/ folder.

- PROJECT-ROOT/
  - Assets/
    - FEATURE-NAME/ # Feature folder
      - Scenes/ # Scene files (.unity) that belongs to the feature
      - Scripts/
        - Editor/ # Editor extension code
          - FEATURE-NAME.Editor.asmdef # Editor extension assembly definition file
        - Runtime/ # Runtime code
          - FEATURE-NAME.asmdef # Runtime assembly definition file
      - Tests/
        - Editor/ # Test code for the editor extension code
          - FEATURE-NAME.Editor.Tests.asmdef # Assembly definition file for tests against the editor extension code
        - Runtime/ # Test code for runtime code
          - FEATURE-NAME.Tests.asmdef # Assembly definition file for tests against the runtime code

An assembly definition file defines the dependencies between assemblies.

## Embedded Package Structure

If you develop a UPM package, the code goes under Packages/ folder.

- PROJECT-ROOT/
  - Packages/
    - PACKAGE-NAME/ # Package folder
      - Editor/ # Editor extension code
        - PACKAGE-NAME.Editor.asmdef # Editor extension assembly definition file
      - Runtime/ # Runtime code
        - PACKAGE-NAME.asmdef # Runtime assembly definition file
      - Tests/
        - Editor/ # Test code for the editor extension code
          - PACKAGE-NAME.Editor.Tests.asmdef # Assembly definition file for tests against the editor extension code
        - Runtime/ # Test code for runtime code
          - PACKAGE-NAME.Tests.asmdef # Assembly definition file for tests against the runtime code

## .meta files

Each file and folder in the project has a corresponding .meta file that contains metadata about the asset, such as its unique identifier (GUID) and import settings. These .meta files are automatically generated by Unity when you create or modify assets.
When you create a file or folder, include the .meta file in the commit to VCS.

## Dependencies

### Dependent UPM packages

Dependent packages that are only referenced are cached under ./Library/PackageCache/ folder.
Installed packages are listed in ./Packages/packages-lock.json file.

### Dependent NuGet packages

The DLL files used from the NuGet packages are extracted and placed in ./Assets/Packages/ folder.
The installed packages are listed in ./Assets/packages.config file.
